[**Homepage of WG**](https://identity.foundation/inteorperability/) | [**Issues**](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/issues) | [**Meeting Recordings/Transcripts**](https://dif.groups.io/g/interop-wg)

## Agendas and minutes

Agendas for future meetings and minutes of past meetings are assembled in a running [document](agenda.md) in the root of the group's github repository.  It is "live-edited" during workinggroup meetings (turning that meeting's agenda into minutes) in a collaboration tool that supports markdown and simultaneous editing (at time of press, that's hackmd.io). 

Although the group is not IPR protected and is entirely open to the public, we still strive to create an environment of respect and attribution, so if you feel the chairs are not crediting speakers or putting enough detail into the minutes, attendees are encouraged to contribute, embellish the minutes with links, fix typos, etc etc.

## Archival multi-media completeness

When in-meeting discussion involves screensharing videos, images, slideshows, task boards, diagrams, etc, we will do our best to get a copy of these files and upload them to the archival record of the group by copying these input documents to the /assets/ folder where appropriate and linking to them from the minutes. As above, feel free to email the chairs if you notice an oversight or a lapse in this policy!

## Recordings of meetings

As per DIF general policy, all meetings should be recorded and hosting on DIF web space to allow members and non-members alike to watch them at their leisure.  The link above should lead you to the recordings to date.
